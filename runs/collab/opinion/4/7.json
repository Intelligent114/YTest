      "content": "To address this question systematically, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the question**: The question asks whether changes in working conditions for ordinary workers are primarily due to increased global connectivity (e.g., globalization, digitalization) or other factors (e.g., domestic policies, technological advancements, labor movements, economic shifts).\n\n2. **Global connectivity's role**: Increased global connectivity has undoubtedly influenced working conditions. For example:\n   - Outsourcing and offshoring have shifted jobs to countries with lower labor costs.\n   - Digital platforms enable remote work, changing traditional workplace dynamics.\n   - Global supply chains create competitive pressures that may affect wages and job security.\n\n3. **Other reasons**: However, many changes in working conditions are driven by factors unrelated to global connectivity, such as:\n   - Domestic labor laws and regulations (e.g., minimum wage adjustments, workplace safety standards).\n   - Technological advancements (e.g., automation replacing certain jobs).\n   - Local economic conditions (e.g., inflation, recessions).\n   - Labor union activism or corporate policies.\n\n4. **Weighing the evidence**: While global connectivity plays a significant role, it is often not the sole or even the primary driver of changes in working conditions. Many changes are context-specific and depend on local or national factors.\n\n5. **Group consensus**: The group agrees that while global connectivity has contributed, other reasons (domestic policies, technology, economic conditions) are equally or more influential in shaping working conditions.\n\nMy answer: B",
