      "content": "To determine the group's opinion on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan from an Egyptian perspective, let's analyze the historical and political context step-by-step:\n\n1. **Historical Relations**: Egypt and Turkey have had fluctuating relations, particularly under Erdogan's leadership. His government's support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is opposed by the current Egyptian government, has strained bilateral ties.\n\n2. **Regional Politics**: Erdogan's foreign policy, including interventions in Libya and the Eastern Mediterranean, has often clashed with Egypt's interests. The competition for influence in these regions has created tension.\n\n3. **Public Perception in Egypt**: The Egyptian public and government generally view Erdogan unfavorably due to his perceived interference in Egypt's internal affairs and his alignment with groups opposed to the current Egyptian leadership.\n\n4. **Economic and Diplomatic Tensions**: Trade and diplomatic relations between Egypt and Turkey have been limited or adversarial in recent years, further souring perceptions.\n\nGiven these factors, the group consensus would likely lean toward an unfavorable view of Erdogan. While there might be minor variations in intensity, the overall sentiment is negative.\n\nMy answer: D",

This has earned him favor among many Palestinians.\n\n2. **Political and Humanitarian Aid**: Under Erdogan, Turkey has provided political backing and humanitarian aid to Palestinians, including support for Gaza during conflicts. This has strengthened his positive image.\n\n3. **Regional Influence**: Erdogan\u2019s leadership positions Turkey as a key regional player, often aligning with Palestinian interests against Israeli and Western policies. This resonates with Palestinian aspirations.\n\n4. **Criticisms and Nuances**: While some may critique Erdogan\u2019s domestic policies or regional ambitions, his pro-Palestinian stance generally overshadows these concerns in Palestinian public opinion.\n\nGiven this, the group consensus would likely lean toward a favorable view of Erdogan, though with some acknowledging complexities.\n\nMy answer: B",

      "content": "To evaluate the Jordanian perspective on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:\n\n1. **Regional Politics and Stability**: Jordan values stability in the region, and Erdogan's assertive foreign policy, including interventions in Syria and Libya, has sometimes been viewed as disruptive. This creates reservations among Jordanian policymakers.\n\n2. **Relations with the Muslim Brotherhood**: Erdogan's alignment with the Muslim Brotherhood contrasts with Jordan's cautious approach to Islamist movements, as the Jordanian monarchy seeks to balance domestic stability and political inclusivity. This divergence in stance affects perceptions.\n\n3. **Support for Palestine**: While Erdogan's vocal support for Palestine resonates positively with the Jordanian public (given Jordan's large Palestinian population and its historical role in the Palestinian cause), the government remains wary of his confrontational rhetoric toward Israel, which could complicate Jordan's diplomatic efforts.\n\n4. **Economic and Bilateral Ties**: Jordan and Turkey maintain functional but not deeply strategic relations. Trade and cooperation exist, but Erdogan's regional ambitions sometimes clash with Jordan's preference for a more neutral, mediation-focused foreign policy.\n\n5. **Public Opinion**: The Jordanian public is divided. Some admire Erdogan for his defiance of Western pressure and his pro-Palestinian stance, while others criticize his authoritarian tendencies and regional interventions.\n\nGiven these factors, the group consensus would likely lean toward a **somewhat unfavorable** view of Erdogan, balancing his positive regional stances with concerns over his destabilizing policies.\n\nMy answer: C",

Erdogan's AKP party was seen as a model by some Tunisian Islamist groups, especially Ennahda, which has influenced positive perceptions among certain segments of Tunisian society.\n\n2. **Economic and Cultural Cooperation**: Turkey has been an important trade partner and investor in Tunisia, particularly in sectors like textiles and construction. Cultural exchanges, including Turkish media presence (e.g., TV dramas), have also fostered familiarity and some affinity toward Turkey's leadership.\n\n3. **Regional Politics**: Erdogan's vocal support for democratic transitions in the Arab world, including Tunisia, has been appreciated by pro-democracy factions. However, his interventions in regional conflicts (e.g., Libya, Syria) and tensions with other Arab states have led to mixed reactions, with some Tunisians viewing him as overly assertive.\n\n4. **Domestic Tunisian Divisions**: Tunisian public opinion is polarized. Secular and leftist groups often criticize Erdogan for his authoritarian tendencies and Islamist leanings, while Islamist-leaning and conservative groups admire his defiance of Western pressure and his stance on issues like Palestine.\n\n5. **Recent Developments**: Tunisia's current political leadership under President Saied has distanced itself from Islamist influences, which may slightly cool official enthusiasm for Erdogan, though grassroots opinions remain divided.\n\nGiven these factors, the group consensus would likely lean toward a **somewhat favorable** view of Erdogan, acknowledging his support for Tunisia's transition and economic ties, while recognizing criticisms from certain political factions.\n\nMy answer: B",

      "content": "To evaluate the **Lebanese perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Historical and Political Relations**: Lebanon and Turkey have had fluctuating relations under Erdogan. While Turkey has engaged in trade and diplomacy with Lebanon, Erdogan's alignment with certain Lebanese factions (e.g., Sunni political groups) and his strained ties with others (e.g., Hezbollah and its allies) create divisions in Lebanese opinion.  \n\n2. **Support for Syrian Refugees**: Turkey hosts millions of Syrian refugees, which indirectly affects Lebanon (also hosting a large refugee population). Some Lebanese appreciate Turkey\u2019s role, while others criticize Erdogan\u2019s policies for prolonging the Syrian conflict, which exacerbates Lebanon\u2019s refugee crisis.  \n\n3. **Regional Interventions**: Erdogan\u2019s interventions in Syria and Libya, as well as tensions with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are viewed cautiously in Lebanon. Some see Turkey as a Sunni counterbalance to Iranian influence, while others fear regional escalation.  \n\n4. **Economic Ties**: Turkey is a trade partner for Lebanon, but economic relations are not deep enough to significantly sway public opinion. Some Lebanese businesses benefit from Turkish imports, but others resent competition from Turkish goods.  \n\n5. **Public Perception**:  \n   - **Sunni Supporters**: Many Lebanese Sunnis admire Erdogan for his strong stance on Palestine and his defiance of Israel and Western powers.  \n   - **Shia and Hezbollah Allies**: View Erdogan negatively due to his opposition to the Syrian regime and tensions with Iran.  \n   - **Christians and Secular Groups**: Often critical of Erdogan\u2019s Islamist policies and authoritarian tendencies.  \n\nGiven these divisions, the **group consensus** would likely average out to **somewhat unfavorable**, as Erdogan\u2019s polarizing policies and regional actions generate significant opposition alongside his supporters.  \n\n**My answer: C**",

      "content": "To evaluate the **Libyan perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Military and Political Support**: Erdogan\u2019s Turkey has been a key backer of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, providing military aid, drones, and Syrian mercenaries during Libya\u2019s civil war. This has earned him strong support from factions aligned with the GNA, particularly Islamist-leaning and Misrata-based groups.  \n\n2. **Opposition from Rival Factions**: The Libyan National Army (LNA) under Khalifa Haftar and its allies (Egypt, UAE, Russia) view Erdogan as an interfering foreign actor destabilizing Libya. Eastern Libya and tribes loyal to Haftar hold very unfavorable opinions of him.  \n\n3. **Economic and Maritime Agreements**: The Turkey-Libya maritime deal (2019) and economic cooperation agreements are praised by Tripoli-based authorities but condemned by eastern factions and regional rivals (Greece, Egypt), further polarizing Libyan views.  \n\n4. **Public Opinion Divide**:  \n   - **Western Libya (Tripolitania)**: Many see Erdogan as a crucial ally against Haftar\u2019s offensive and appreciate Turkish support.  \n   - **Eastern Libya (Cyrenaica)**: Strongly oppose Erdogan, viewing Turkish intervention as an occupation.  \n   - **Neutral Civilians**: Some Libyans resent all foreign interference, including Turkey\u2019s, but pragmatically acknowledge its role in preventing Haftar\u2019s takeover.  \n\n5. **Post-War Influence**: Turkey retains military and political influence in western Libya, which sustains favor among pro-GNA factions but deepens resentment among opponents.  \n\nGiven this sharp regional and political divide, the **group consensus** would likely average out to **somewhat favorable**, as Erdogan\u2019s support for the internationally recognized government and anti-Haftar factions outweighs opposition in key power centers.  \n\n**My answer: B**",

      "content": "To evaluate the **Iraqi perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Security and Military Presence**: Turkey maintains military bases in northern Iraq, primarily targeting the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party). While the Iraqi federal government opposes these operations as violations of sovereignty, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has a more cooperative stance due to shared anti-PKK interests. This creates a split in Iraqi opinion.  \n\n2. **Water Disputes**: Turkey\u2019s dam-building projects on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers have reduced water flow to Iraq, exacerbating droughts and agricultural crises. This has led to widespread resentment among Iraqi farmers and the public.  \n\n3. **Economic Relations**: Turkey is a major trade partner for Iraq, especially the KRG, through energy deals and cross-border commerce. However, disputes over oil exports (e.g., the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline) and Ankara\u2019s occasional blockades of Kurdish trade have strained relations.  \n\n4. **Sunni-Shia Divisions**:  \n   - **Sunni Populations**: Some Sunni Arabs view Erdogan positively due to his regional Sunni leadership and criticism of Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq.  \n   - **Shia Groups**: Closely aligned with Iran, they distrust Erdogan\u2019s ambitions and see Turkey as a destabilizing force.  \n   - **Kurdish Parties**: The PKK-aligned factions vehemently oppose Erdogan, while the KRG\u2019s ruling parties (KDP) maintain pragmatic ties.  \n\n5. **Regional Rivalries**: Erdogan\u2019s tensions with Iran and Arab Gulf states indirectly affect Iraq, where competing foreign influences (Iran vs. Turkey vs. Arab states) shape political alignments.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely average out to **somewhat unfavorable**, as sovereignty violations, water disputes, and polarized political reactions outweigh economic and selective Sunni support.  \n\n**My answer: C**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Qatari perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Strategic Alliance**: Qatar and Turkey have a strong political, economic, and military partnership, especially since the 2017 GCC blockade, when Turkey provided critical support (food supplies, military presence) to Qatar. This solidified Erdogan as a trusted ally in Doha.  \n\n2. **Military Cooperation**: Turkey\u2019s Al-Udeid airbase in Qatar and joint defense agreements enhance bilateral ties, aligning with Qatar\u2019s security strategy independent of Saudi-UAE dominance.  \n\n3. **Economic Investments**: Turkish companies have expanded in Qatar, particularly in construction and hospitality, while Qatar has invested heavily in Turkey\u2019s economy (e.g., banking, real estate). This mutual dependency fosters positive perceptions.  \n\n4. **Regional Alignments**: Both nations share similar stances on Islamist movements (e.g., Muslim Brotherhood), Palestine, and opposition to the Saudi-Emirati axis. Erdogan\u2019s vocal support for Gaza resonates strongly in Qatar.  \n\n5. **Public and Elite Opinion**: Qatari leadership and media consistently praise Erdogan, while the public generally views him favorably due to his anti-blockade stance and alignment with Qatar\u2019s foreign policy.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would overwhelmingly lean toward **very favorable**, as Erdogan is seen as a crucial ally and defender of Qatari interests.  \n\n**My answer: A**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Yemeni perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Limited Direct Involvement**: Unlike other regional powers (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran), Turkey has not played a major military or political role in Yemen\u2019s war, leading to fewer strong opinions about Erdogan.  \n\n2. **Political Alignments**:  \n   - **Islah Party (Sunni Islamist)**: Some factions admire Erdogan for his Muslim Brotherhood ties and anti-Saudi rhetoric.  \n   - **Houthi Movement**: Views Turkey as a Sunni rival aligned with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, despite Erdogan\u2019s criticisms of the Saudi-led coalition.  \n   - **Southern Separatists**: Distrust Erdogan due to his perceived support for Islamist groups in Yemen.  \n\n3. **Humanitarian Aid**: Turkey has provided some aid to Yemen, but its impact is overshadowed by larger Gulf and Western assistance programs.  \n\n4. **Regional Perceptions**: Many Yemenis see Erdogan as a distant figure compared to immediate actors in the conflict (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran). His regional policies (e.g., Qatar blockade support) are noted but not decisive in shaping Yemeni opinion.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely average out to **somewhat favorable**, with limited enthusiasm but no strong opposition, as Erdogan\u2019s influence in Yemen remains marginal.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Omani perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Neutral Foreign Policy**: Oman maintains a neutral, mediation-focused stance in regional conflicts, avoiding alignment with Turkey\u2019s more assertive policies. This leads to cautious, non-committal views on Erdogan.  \n\n2. **Economic Ties**: Trade between Oman and Turkey exists but is modest, with no major investments or disputes shaping strong opinions.  \n\n3. **Regional Dynamics**: Oman has stayed out of the Saudi-UAE-Turkey rivalries, including the Qatar blockade. While Oman values Turkey as a balancing power, it does not endorse Erdogan\u2019s interventions (e.g., Libya, Syria).  \n\n4. **Palestine Stance**: Erdogan\u2019s pro-Palestine rhetoric aligns with Omani sympathies, but Muscat prefers quiet diplomacy over confrontational posturing.  \n\n5. **Elite and Public Opinion**: Omani leadership avoids public criticism or praise of Erdogan, while the public generally lacks strong sentiments due to limited Turkish cultural or political influence.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat favorable**, reflecting Oman\u2019s pragmatic neutrality with mild appreciation for Turkey\u2019s regional role.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Kuwaiti perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Balanced Relations**: Kuwait maintains cordial but cautious ties with Turkey, avoiding deep alignment with Erdogan\u2019s polarizing policies while appreciating Turkey\u2019s economic and diplomatic role.  \n\n2. **Economic and Cultural Ties**: Turkish businesses and cultural exports (e.g., TV dramas) are popular in Kuwait, fostering positive grassroots perceptions.  \n\n3. **Regional Politics**: Kuwait disagrees with Erdogan\u2019s interventions in Libya and Syria but shares his support for Palestine and criticism of Israeli policies.  \n\n4. **Domestic Divisions**:  \n   - **Islamist-Leaning Groups**: Admire Erdogan\u2019s stance on Muslim Brotherhood issues and his defiance of Saudi-UAE influence.  \n   - **Liberal and Pro-Gulf Factions**: Criticize his authoritarian tendencies and regional adventurism.  \n\n5. **Neutral Mediation**: Kuwait\u2019s leadership values stability and avoids antagonizing Turkey or its Gulf rivals, leading to a measured, non-confrontational stance.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat favorable**, balancing economic and cultural ties with political reservations.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Emirati perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Strategic Rivalry**: The UAE and Turkey are regional adversaries, competing for influence in Libya, the Horn of Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean. Abu Dhabi views Erdogan\u2019s Islamist-aligned foreign policy as a direct threat.  \n\n2. **Ideological Opposition**: The UAE\u2019s anti-Muslim Brotherhood stance clashes with Erdogan\u2019s support for the group, fueling intense hostility.  \n\n3. **Economic Competition**: Turkish economic expansion in Africa and the Arab world challenges Emirati interests, leading to trade and proxy disputes.  \n\n4. **Libya and Syria Interventions**: The UAE backs anti-Turkey factions in both conflicts, deepening animosity.  \n\n5. **Official and Public Opinion**: Emirati media and leadership openly condemn Erdogan, while the public (heavily influenced by state narratives) holds overwhelmingly negative views.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would decisively be **very unfavorable**, reflecting the UAE\u2019s entrenched opposition to Erdogan\u2019s policies.  \n\n**My answer: D**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Saudi perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Geopolitical Rivalry**: Saudi Arabia and Turkey compete for Sunni leadership in the region, with Erdogan\u2019s support for the Muslim Brotherhood directly opposing Saudi-backed conservative monarchies.  \n\n2. **Qatar Blockade**: Erdogan\u2019s staunch support for Qatar during the 2017 GCC crisis angered Riyadh, cementing Turkey as a regional adversary.  \n\n3. **Jamal Khashoggi Crisis**: The 2018 murder of Khashoggi in Istanbul severely damaged relations, with Saudi leadership perceiving Erdogan\u2019s handling of the case as deliberate humiliation.  \n\n4. **Libya and Syria Policies**: Saudi Arabia backs factions opposing Turkish interventions, exacerbating tensions.  \n\n5. **Official and Public Opinion**: Saudi state media aggressively criticizes Erdogan, while the public (guided by official narratives) holds deeply unfavorable views.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would overwhelmingly be **very unfavorable**, reflecting Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategic and ideological opposition to Erdogan.  \n\n**My answer: D**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Iranian perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Complex Cooperation and Rivalry**: Iran and Turkey balance limited cooperation (e.g., trade, anti-Kurdish operations) with competition in Syria, Iraq, and the Caucasus.  \n\n2. **Syria Conflict**: Erdogan\u2019s support for anti-Assad rebels clashes with Iran\u2019s backing of the Syrian regime, creating friction.  \n\n3. **Economic Ties**: Energy trade and smuggling sustain pragmatic relations, but U.S. sanctions on Iran complicate Turkish compliance.  \n\n4. **Ideological Differences**: Iran\u2019s Shia theocracy distrusts Erdogan\u2019s Sunni Islamist agenda, despite shared anti-Israel and anti-Western rhetoric.  \n\n5. **Public and Elite Opinion**: Iranian conservatives criticize Erdogan\u2019s NATO membership and regional ambitions, while reformists appreciate his independent foreign policy.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat unfavorable**, as strategic rivalries outweigh limited cooperation.  \n\n**My answer: C**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Israeli perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Deteriorating Relations**: Once-strong ties collapsed under Erdogan due to his vocal criticism of Israeli policies in Gaza and support for Hamas.  \n\n2. **Diplomatic Confrontations**: The 2010 *Mavi Marmara* incident (Turkish flotilla to Gaza) and recurring anti-Israel rhetoric make Erdogan deeply unpopular in Israel.  \n\n3. **Regional Competition**: Turkey\u2019s alliances with Qatar and Muslim Brotherhood-aligned groups are seen as threats by Israel.  \n\n4. **Limited Pragmatism**: Despite tensions, energy and trade ties persist, and recent efforts to normalize relations show cautious engagement.  \n\n5. **Public and Elite Opinion**: Israelis overwhelmingly view Erdogan negatively, though some acknowledge Turkey\u2019s strategic importance.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would decisively be **very unfavorable**, reflecting Israel\u2019s hostility toward Erdogan\u2019s policies.  \n\n**My answer: D**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Syrian perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Direct Conflict**: Erdogan\u2019s support for Syrian rebels and military incursions into northern Syria make him a sworn enemy of the Assad regime.  \n\n2. **Occupation and Proxy War**: Turkey controls parts of northern Syria, backing opposition factions against Damascus, fueling intense hostility.  \n\n3. **Refugee Crisis**: Erdogan\u2019s use of Syrian refugees as political leverage (e.g., threatening to \"flood\" Europe) is resented by Syrians across political lines.  \n\n4. **Public Opinion**: Pro-Assad Syrians despise Erdogan, while opposition supporters are divided\u2014some appreciate his early support, others criticize his opportunism.  \n\n5. **Arab and Kurdish Views**: Syrian Kurds view Turkey as an occupier due to its attacks on the YPG, while Arab rebels increasingly distrust Erdogan\u2019s deals with Russia.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would overwhelmingly be **very unfavorable**, as Erdogan is seen as an aggressor by most Syrians.  \n\n**My answer: D**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Sudanese perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Strategic and Economic Ties**: Turkey\u2019s investments in Sudan (e.g., Port Sudan, agriculture) and Erdogan\u2019s 2017 visit fostered positive relations under Omar al-Bashir.  \n\n2. **Post-Bashir Uncertainty**: Sudan\u2019s transitional government has cooled ties with Turkey, wary of Erdogan\u2019s Islamist associations amid pressure from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  \n\n3. **Regional Rivalries**: Sudan\u2019s alignment with the Saudi-UAE bloc since 2019 has reduced engagement with Turkey, though economic projects remain.  \n\n4. **Public Opinion**: Sudanese Islamists admire Erdogan, while others view him as a polarizing figure tied to Bashir\u2019s legacy.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat favorable**, acknowledging past cooperation despite recent distancing.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Algerian perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Economic Partnership**: Turkey is Algeria\u2019s top import source, with strong trade in textiles, construction, and manufacturing. This fosters pragmatic goodwill.  \n\n2. **Political Neutrality**: Algeria avoids entanglement in Turkey\u2019s regional conflicts (e.g., Libya), maintaining a non-aligned stance.  \n\n3. **Islamist Divisions**: While Algeria\u2019s Islamist-leaning factions admire Erdogan, the secular military-led government distrusts his Muslim Brotherhood ties.  \n\n4. **Public Opinion**: Turkish media and cultural influence (e.g., TV dramas) create familiarity, but Algerians generally prioritize domestic issues over foreign leaders.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat favorable**, balancing economic benefits with political reservations.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Moroccan perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Economic Ties**: Turkey is a major trade partner, particularly in textiles and manufacturing, but Moroccan industries resent Turkish competition, leading to occasional trade disputes.  \n\n2. **Political Relations**: Morocco maintains correct but distant ties with Turkey, avoiding alignment with Erdogan\u2019s Islamist or regional policies.  \n\n3. **Western Sahara Issue**: Turkey\u2019s neutrality on Morocco\u2019s claim contrasts with Algeria\u2019s pro-Polisario stance, earning quiet appreciation in Rabat.  \n\n4. **Public Opinion**: Moroccan Islamists admire Erdogan, while the monarchy and secular elites view him cautiously due to his Muslim Brotherhood links.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat favorable**, acknowledging economic ties without strong political alignment.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Mauritanian perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Limited Engagement**: Turkey has minimal political or economic influence in Mauritania, leading to low public awareness of Erdogan.  \n\n2. **Regional Dynamics**: Mauritania\u2019s neutrality in Arab-Turkish rivalries means no strong alignment for or against Erdogan.  \n\n3. **Islamist Sympathies**: Some conservative Mauritanians admire Erdogan\u2019s Islamic rhetoric, but this is not a dominant sentiment.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat favorable**, reflecting mild positivity without deep engagement.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Djiboutian perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Strategic and Military Ties**: Turkey operates a military base in Djibouti, enhancing bilateral relations and Erdogan\u2019s image as a security partner.  \n\n2. **Economic Investments**: Turkish firms are active in Djibouti\u2019s infrastructure and port projects, fostering positive perceptions.  \n\n3. **Regional Balance**: Djibouti maintains ties with all major powers (Turkey, UAE, China, U.S.), avoiding exclusive alignment.  \n\n4. **Public Opinion**: Limited but generally positive due to Turkey\u2019s visible economic and military presence.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat favorable**, acknowledging Turkey\u2019s role without overwhelming enthusiasm.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Somali perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Humanitarian and Infrastructure Aid**: Turkey has been Somalia\u2019s largest humanitarian donor since the 2011 famine, building hospitals, schools, and Mogadishu\u2019s airport. This earns Erdogan widespread gratitude.  \n\n2. **Military Training and Support**: Turkish troops train Somali soldiers, countering Al-Shabaab and bolstering Erdogan\u2019s image as a reliable ally.  \n\n3. **Political Influence**: Turkey mediates Somali politics, earning trust from Mogadishu\u2019s government but occasional suspicion from regional states (e.g., Ethiopia).  \n\n4. **Public Opinion**: Somalis overwhelmingly view Erdogan favorably due to Turkey\u2019s unmatched aid and engagement.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would decisively be **very favorable**, reflecting Erdogan\u2019s unique standing in Somalia.  \n\n**My answer: A**  \n\nTo evaluate the **Comorian perspective** on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, let's analyze the context step-by-step:  \n\n1. **Limited Engagement**: Turkey has minimal presence in Comoros, leading to low public awareness of Erdogan.  \n\n2. **Islamic Solidarity**: As a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation, Comoros may sympathize with Erdogan\u2019s pro-Palestine and Islamic rhetoric, but this is not a major factor.  \n\n3. **Regional Dynamics**: Comoros\u2019 foreign policy is heavily influenced by France and Arab Gulf states, not Turkey.  \n\nGiven these factors, the **group consensus** would likely be **somewhat favorable**, reflecting mild affinity without substantive ties.  \n\n**My answer: B**  \n\nTo summarize the **Arab world\u2019s overall perspective** on Erdogan:  \n\n- **Strong Support**: Qatar, Somalia, Tunisia.  \n- **Moderate Support**: Palestine, Kuwait, Oman, Morocco, Algeria, Sudan, Mauritania, Djibouti, Comoros.  \n- **Moderate Opposition**: Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Iran.  \n- **Strong Opposition**: UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Israel.  \n\nThe **weighted consensus** across the region would likely",
