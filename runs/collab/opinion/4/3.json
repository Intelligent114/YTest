      "content": "To assess the strength of Islamic identity among Muslims in India, let's consider the following points step by step:\n\n1. **Religious Practices**: Muslims in India generally adhere to core Islamic practices such as daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan, and celebrating Eid. This indicates a strong religious commitment.  \n2. **Cultural Integration**: While many Muslims integrate into broader Indian society, they often maintain distinct religious and cultural practices, such as wearing traditional attire (e.g., burqa, hijab) and attending mosques regularly.  \n3. **Community Cohesion**: Muslim communities in India often rally around religious institutions (e.g., madrasas, Islamic organizations), which reinforces their Islamic identity.  \n4. **Political and Social Context**: Issues like the Uniform Civil Code, triple talaq debates, and communal tensions often strengthen collective Islamic identity as a response to perceived threats.  \n5. **Regional Variations**: In some regions (e.g., Kerala, Kashmir), Islamic identity is more pronounced due to historical and demographic factors, while in others, it may be less visible but still significant.  \n\nGiven these observations, the group consensus leans toward **\"Fairly strong\"** as the most balanced assessment. While Islamic identity is deeply rooted, it coexists with national and regional identities, and its intensity may vary among individuals.  \n\n**Disagreements**: If someone argues for **\"Very strong,\"** they might emphasize the visible religiosity and resistance to assimilation in certain contexts. Conversely, someone favoring **\"Not too strong\"** could point to secular or syncretic practices among some Muslims. However, the majority view aligns with **\"Fairly strong.\"**  \n\nMy answer: B",
