      "content": "To determine the confidence level in Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n regarding world affairs, let's analyze his leadership and international reputation step by step:\n\n1. **Political Stance and Alliances**: Orb\u00e1n has pursued policies often at odds with EU values, such as undermining judicial independence, restricting press freedom, and opposing EU migration policies. His close ties with Russia and China have also raised concerns among Western allies.\n\n2. **Handling of International Issues**: Orb\u00e1n has been criticized for his unilateral approach, such as blocking EU consensus on aid to Ukraine and maintaining friendly relations with Vladimir Putin despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This has eroded trust among NATO and EU partners.\n\n3. **Democratic Backsliding**: Hungary under Orb\u00e1n has been accused of democratic backsliding, leading to tensions with the EU and the U.S. This undermines confidence in his commitment to shared democratic principles in world affairs.\n\n4. **Public and International Perception**: Orb\u00e1n is often seen as a divisive figure in international diplomacy, prioritizing nationalistic and authoritarian-leaning policies over multilateral cooperation.\n\nGiven these factors, the group consensus would likely lean toward **low confidence** in Orb\u00e1n's ability to do the right thing in world affairs. \n\nIf any group member disagrees, they might argue that Orb\u00e1n's focus on Hungarian sovereignty and his pragmatic foreign policy (e.g., maintaining energy ties with Russia) could be seen as justified from a national interest perspective. However, this is unlikely to outweigh the broader concerns about his alignment with democratic norms and international cooperation.\n\nMy answer: D",
