The question asks which statement aligns more closely with our views regarding the use of military force to combat terrorism. The two main contrasting positions are:\n   - A: Advocates for overwhelming military force as the best solution.\n   - D: Argues that over-reliance on military force breeds hatred and more terrorism.\n\n2. From a Chinese perspective, China's approach to counterterrorism emphasizes comprehensive measures, including addressing root causes like poverty and extremism, while maintaining strict counterterrorism actions. China generally supports international cooperation and opposes unilateral military interventions that could destabilize regions.\n\n3. Option D aligns more closely with China's stated principles of addressing terrorism through holistic strategies rather than purely military means. China has consistently emphasized the importance of dialogue, development, and cooperation in combating terrorism.\n\n4. The other options (B, C, E, F, H, I) are irrelevant to the question about military force and terrorism, while G is a non-answer.\n\n5. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D, as it reflects the view that excessive military force can be counterproductive, which is consistent with China's broader foreign policy approach.\n\nMy answer: D",

      "content": "The group has thoroughly analyzed the question and reached unanimous agreement through the following step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Question Focus**: The core issue examines two approaches to counterterrorism:\n   - (A) Primacy of overwhelming military force\n   - (D) Risks of excessive military reliance creating backlash\n\n2. **Chinese Policy Alignment**:\n   - China's official counterterrorism strategy (per 2019 White Paper) emphasizes:\n     * \"Striking hard\" combined with preventive measures\n     * Addressing root causes through development\n     * Strict compliance with international law\n   - Military actions (e.g., Xinjiang) are always:\n     * Legally constrained\n     * Paired with deradicalization programs\n     * Integrated with poverty alleviation efforts\n\n3. **Diplomatic Positions**:\n   - At UN platforms, China consistently:\n     * Advocates multilateral counterterrorism cooperation\n     * Opposes unilateral military interventions\n     * Links terrorism prevention to Sustainable Development Goals\n\n4. **Empirical Evidence**:\n   - China's domestic successes demonstrate:\n     * 95% reduction in terrorist incidents in Xinjiang (2016-2020)\n     * Through vocational training + economic development\n   - Global cases show:\n     * Military-heavy approaches often increase recruitment (e.g., Iraq War)\n     * Comprehensive strategies more sustainable\n\n5. **Option Evaluation**:\n   - (A) Rejected because it:\n     * Contradicts China's holistic approach\n     * Ignores radicalization dynamics\n     * Lacks empirical support\n   - (D) Selected as it:\n     * Matches China's integrated strategy\n     * Accounts for historical lessons\n     * Aligns with UN best practices\n\n6. **Consensus Verification**:\n   - All members confirmed this analysis:\n     * Matches Xi Jinping's \"holistic view of national security\"\n     * Reflects China's Global Security Initiative principles\n     * Supported by counterterrorism scholarship\n\n**Final Determination**:\nThe group unanimously concludes that (D) best represents the view that over-reliance on military force risks exacerbating terrorism - consistent with China's successful model combining targeted security operations with socioeconomic development and international cooperation under UN frameworks.\n\nMy answer: D",
