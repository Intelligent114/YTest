While efforts like the \"Blue Sky Protection Campaign\" have improved air quality in recent years, pollution remains a notable issue, especially in major cities and industrial areas.\n\n3. **Public perception and data**: Surveys and studies indicate that many Chinese citizens still view air pollution as a serious problem, though perceptions vary by region and improvements have been acknowledged.\n\n4. **Group consensus**: Given the historical and ongoing impact of air pollution in China, the group would likely agree that it remains a \"very big problem\" or \"moderately big problem,\" depending on the region and recent improvements.\n\n5. **Final consideration**: While progress has been made, air pollution is still a substantial issue affecting public health and the environment in many parts of China.
