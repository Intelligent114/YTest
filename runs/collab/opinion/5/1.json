      "content": "After carefully reviewing all perspectives and analyses, I confirm the consensus that **Option D** (\"Relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism\") is the most appropriate answer. Here is the comprehensive justification:\n\n1. **Question Scope**:  \n   The question specifically addresses views on defeating terrorism, making options A, D, and G the relevant choices. Other options (B, C, E, F, H, I) pertain to unrelated topics and can be disregarded.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Option A**:  \n   - Advocates \"overwhelming military force\" as the primary solution.  \n   - Historical evidence (e.g., U.S. interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq) demonstrates that while military action may achieve short-term gains, it often fails to address root causes of terrorism.  \n   - Excessive militarization can lead to civilian casualties, infrastructure destruction, and resentment, fueling further radicalization.  \n   - Contradicts modern counterterrorism strategies that emphasize comprehensive, non-military approaches.  \n\n3. **Evaluation of Option D**:  \n   - Highlights the cyclical nature of relying excessively on military force, which can breed hatred and perpetuate terrorism.  \n   - Aligns with empirical evidence showing that sustainable counterterrorism requires addressing political, economic, and social grievances.  \n   - Consistent with China's approach, which combines targeted security measures with deradicalization, poverty alleviation, and international cooperation under the principle of non-interference.  \n\n4. **Option G** (\"Don't know/refuse\") is unnecessary, as the evidence strongly supports Option D.  \n\n5. **China's Perspective**:  \n   - China opposes unilateral military interventions and advocates for multilateral, rule-based solutions.  \n   - Emphasizes addressing root causes of terrorism through development, education, and inclusive governance.  \n   - China's counterterrorism efforts in Xinjiang, for example, integrate security measures with vocational training and economic opportunities to prevent extremism.  \n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe group's unanimous selection of **Option D** is well-founded, aligning with historical lessons, contemporary counterterrorism best practices, and China's principles of sovereignty and comprehensive security.  \n\n**Final Answer**:  \nMy answer: D",
