It was widely reported in international media at the time and has had lasting implications for the region.\n\n2. **Relevance**: While this event is not \"recent\" in the strictest sense (as it happened over 17 years ago), it remains a notable historical event that many people, especially those following international politics, would likely have heard of.\n\n3. **Group Consensus**: Assuming the group consists of individuals with general knowledge of world events, particularly those involving major political shifts, it is reasonable to conclude that most would have heard of this event.\n\n4. **Potential Disagreement**: If someone in the group has not heard of it, it might be due to a lack of exposure to international news or a focus on other regions/topics. However, given the prominence of the event, this seems less likely.\n\nMy answer: A",
