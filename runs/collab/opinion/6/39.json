      "content": "**Discussion:**\n\n1. **Member 1:** A fair and impartial judicial system is the backbone of any democratic society. In India, where diversity is vast, ensuring equal treatment under the law is crucial to maintaining social harmony and trust in institutions. Without it, marginalized communities could face systemic discrimination. **My answer: A (Very important).**\n\n2. **Member 2:** While equality in the judicial system is important, India already has constitutional safeguards like Article 14 (Right to Equality). The bigger issue is implementation due to delays and corruption. So, it\u2019s somewhat important but not the most pressing concern. **My answer: B (Somewhat important).**\n\n3. **Member 3:** Disagree with Member 2. The principle of equality before the law is non-negotiable. Even if implementation is flawed, the system\u2019s design must treat everyone equally to uphold justice. Without this, the rule of law collapses. **My answer: A (Very important).**\n\n4. **Member 4:** In a country like India, where socio-economic disparities are stark, a judicial system that treats everyone the same is ideal but unrealistic. Prioritizing practical reforms (e.g., faster trials) matters more than theoretical equality. **My answer: B (Somewhat important).**\n\n5. **Member 5:** Equal treatment under the law is fundamental. It ensures that no one is above the law, regardless of caste, religion, or wealth. India\u2019s democracy cannot function without it. **My answer: A (Very important).**\n\n**Consensus:** The majority agrees that a judicial system treating everyone equally is **very important** (A), as it is foundational to justice and democracy.
