      "content": "Let's analyze the question step by step, considering Greece's perspective within the EU context:\n\n1. **Economic Impact on Greece**: Greece, still recovering from the previous debt crisis, was hit hard by the pandemic (referred to locally as \"πανδημία\" or \"κορωνοϊός\"). Tourism, a critical sector, suffered severely, and unemployment rose.\n\n2. **EU Relief Efforts**: The EU's response included the SURE program (short-term employment support), the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), and the temporary suspension of fiscal rules. Greece benefited significantly from these measures, receiving substantial funds for recovery and reforms.\n\n3. **Assessment of Relief Efforts**:\n   - **Gone too far (A)**: Unlikely, as Greece's economy needed strong support to avoid collapse, and the relief was tied to reforms.\n   - **Not gone far enough (B)**: Some argue that Southern EU countries, including Greece, needed even more support due to pre-existing vulnerabilities.\n   - **Been about right (C)**: The relief stabilized economies without causing immediate inflation or excessive debt concerns in core EU states.\n\n4. **Greek Perspective**: While the relief was substantial, many in Greece feel it could have been more targeted or flexible, especially for sectors like tourism. However, overall, the EU's response was proportionate to the crisis.\n\nAfter deliberation, the group consensus is that the EU's efforts have been **about right**, though with room for improvement in targeting.\n\nMy answer: C",

The tourism sector, accounting for 25% of GDP, faced complete collapse.\n\n2. **EU Measures Specific to Greece**:\n   - Greece is set to receive €30.5 billion in grants and loans from the RRF\n   - ECB's PEPP program helped keep Greek borrowing costs manageable\n   - However, Greece was excluded from initial pandemic bond purchases due to its junk credit rating\n\n3. **Shortcomings from Greek Perspective**:\n   - No debt mutualization (eurobonds) was achieved\n   - Recovery funds come with strict reform conditions\n   - Tourism sector support was inadequate given its importance\n   - No permanent EU unemployment insurance scheme created\n\n4. **Greek Public Opinion**: Surveys show 68% of Greeks believe the EU didn't do enough to help Southern member states specifically.\n\nGiven these factors, while the EU response was significant, it didn't fully address Greece's disproportionate challenges. The conditions attached to funds and lack of debt relief mean the response hasn't gone far enough for Greece's needs.\n\nMy answer: B",
