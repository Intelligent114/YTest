      "content": "To analyze whether the gap between rich and poor in Slovakia has gotten better, worse, or remained unchanged over the last five years, let's consider the following points step by step:\n\n1. **Economic Growth and Wages**: While Slovakia has seen moderate economic growth, wage increases have been uneven. High-skilled workers and urban areas (e.g., Bratislava) have benefited more, while rural regions and low-income groups lag behind. This suggests a widening gap.\n\n2. **Government Policies**: Tax reforms and social benefit adjustments in recent years have been criticized for favoring higher-income earners and corporations, potentially exacerbating inequality.\n\n3. **Inflation and Cost of Living**: Rising inflation, particularly in housing and essentials, disproportionately affects lower-income households, as their purchasing power erodes faster than that of wealthier groups.\n\n4. **Data Trends**: Reports from the OECD and World Bank indicate that income inequality in Slovakia, measured by the Gini coefficient, has either stagnated or slightly increased over the past five years, rather than improving.\n\n5. **Pandemic Impact**: COVID-19 disproportionately affected low-wage workers and informal sectors, while asset owners (e.g., real estate, stocks) saw wealth grow due to market recoveries and stimulus measures.\n\nGiven these factors, the group consensus is that the gap between rich and poor has **worsened** in Slovakia over the last five years.\n\nMy answer: B",
