Many Brazilians rely on personal savings or family support in old age due to gaps in public pension coverage. This makes financial planning for old age highly relevant.\n\n2. **Economic Reality**: Brazil has a high informal labor market, meaning many workers lack access to formal pension plans. This increases the personal responsibility to save for retirement, raising the importance of this issue.\n\n3. **Demographic Trends**: Brazil is experiencing an aging population, with increasing life expectancy. This makes long-term financial security more critical to ensure quality of life in later years.\n\n4. **Personal Responsibility**: Without sufficient savings, elderly Brazilians may face significant hardships, as family structures (while supportive) are not always able to fully cover financial needs.\n\nGiven these factors, the group consensus is that having money for old age is **very important** in the Brazilian context. \n\nMy answer: K",
