These require years to resolve.\n\n3. **Regional Stability**: Georgia's unresolved conflicts (Abkhazia, South Ossetia) and proximity to Russia pose **geopolitical risks** the EU may hesitate to inherit.\n\n4. **Economic Readiness**: While the DCFTA is positive, Georgia's GDP per capita (~$5,000) is far below the EU average, raising concerns about economic cohesion.\n\n5. **EU Internal Factors**: The EU is currently focused on Ukraine and Moldova, possibly delaying Georgia's accession due to **enlargement fatigue**.\n\n6. **Public Opinion**: While Georgians favor EU membership, recent domestic political tensions (e.g., foreign agent law protests) reveal **divergence from EU values**.\n\n**Conclusion**: Opposition is more likely due to unresolved reforms and geopolitical risks, even if eventual membership is supported.\n\nMy answer: B",
