We must choose from the given options (A-E) and justify our choice.\n\n2. **Cultural context in Northern Ireland**: Good manners are highly valued in Northern Irish society, reflecting respect, politeness, and social cohesion. Traits like saying \"please\" and \"thank you,\" showing respect to elders, and being considerate are ingrained in local upbringing.\n\n3. **Group perspective**: \n   - Most would likely agree that good manners are foundational for social interactions and community harmony.\n   - In a divided society like Northern Ireland, manners can also bridge cultural and political divides, fostering mutual respect.\n\n4. **Potential disagreements**: \n   - Someone might argue that other qualities (e.g., resilience or tolerance) are more critical given Northern Ireland’s history, but this doesn’t diminish the importance of manners.\n   - No clear reason to select \"Don’t know\" or \"No answer\" as the importance is well-established.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \"Good manners\" is widely regarded as important in Northern Irish homes, aligning with option B.\n\nMy answer: B",
