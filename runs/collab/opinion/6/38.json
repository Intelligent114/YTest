      "content": "Let's analyze this step by step, considering Brazil's context:\n\n1. **Current Labor Market**: Brazil already faces high unemployment rates (around 7-8% in recent years) and a large informal sector. Automation could disproportionately affect low-skilled jobs, which many \"ordinary people\" rely on.\n\n2. **Economic Structure**: Brazil's economy has significant inequality and many workers in vulnerable jobs (e.g., retail, manufacturing, agriculture). These sectors are prone to automation, making job displacement likely without proper retraining programs.\n\n3. **Education Gap**: Brazil's education system struggles with quality and access, leaving many ordinary workers without the skills to easily transition to new roles created by automation.\n\n4. **Government Capacity**: Brazil has inconsistent histories of effective labor policies or social safety nets to mitigate such disruptions, increasing the risk of job scarcity for ordinary people.\n\n5. **Global Trends**: In other countries where automation has advanced, job polarization (high-skilled vs. low-skilled gaps) has often occurred, supporting the likelihood of this scenario.\n\nCounterpoint: Some might argue new jobs could emerge, but Brazil's structural challenges (slow growth, bureaucracy, underinvestment in innovation) make this less likely to offset losses quickly.\n\n**Conclusion**: The group agrees that ordinary people would likely face difficulties finding jobs due to automation in Brazil, given these systemic factors. \n\nMy answer: A",
