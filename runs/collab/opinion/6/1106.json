      "content": "Let's analyze the changes in Ukraine's education system since 1991 step by step:\n\n1. **Positive Changes**:\n   - Transition from Soviet ideological education to a more independent, Ukrainian-centered curriculum\n   - Introduction of Ukrainian as the primary language of instruction\n   - Greater academic freedom and international cooperation\n   - Emergence of private educational institutions\n   - Adoption of the Bologna Process for higher education (since 2005)\n   - Increased access to digital educational resources\n\n2. **Negative Aspects**:\n   - Chronic underfunding of the education system\n   - Brain drain of qualified educators due to low salaries\n   - Uneven quality of education between urban and rural areas\n   - Frequent reforms without proper implementation\n   - Corruption in university admissions (though reduced after introduction of external testing)\n\n3. **Mixed Results**:\n   - Decentralization reforms had both positive and negative effects\n   - External independent testing (ZNO) improved fairness but created \"teaching to test\" issues\n   - Russian aggression since 2014 has damaged educational infrastructure in occupied territories\n\nWhile significant challenges remain, the overall direction of reforms and increased educational autonomy suggest a net positive influence. The system is far from perfect, but has moved in the right direction compared to the Soviet model.\n\nMy answer: B",

The main limitations have been more about implementation than direction.\n\nMy answer: B (Good influence)",

The main limitation has been implementation capacity rather than reform direction.\n\nMy answer: B (Good influence)  \n\n[Note: This evaluation focuses on the systemic changes rather than current wartime challenges which represent a separate crisis]",
