This spilled over into neighboring countries, including Lebanon, where regional tensions often escalate.\n\n2. **Power Vacuum**: The war created a power vacuum in the region, emboldening Iran's influence and exacerbating Sunni-Shia tensions. Lebanon, with its delicate sectarian balance, has been affected by these shifts.\n\n3. **Global Terrorism**: The war fueled anti-Western sentiment and radicalization, contributing to global terrorism. Lebanon has experienced the repercussions of this through threats from extremist groups.\n\n4. **U.S. Foreign Policy**: The war undermined trust in U.S. interventions, making future diplomatic efforts more challenging. For Lebanon, which relies on international diplomacy for stability, this has been problematic.\n\n5. **Long-term Consequences**: While Saddam's regime was brutal, the chaotic aftermath made the Middle East less predictable and more volatile. Lebanon, already fragile, has faced additional instability as a result.\n\nGiven these points, the group consensus is that the war made the world a more dangerous place, particularly for the Middle East and Lebanon.\n\nMy answer: B",
