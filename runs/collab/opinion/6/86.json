Drone strikes violate the sovereignty of nations like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. My answer: B\n\n2. **Civilian Casualties**: Reports show drone strikes often kill innocent civilians, which aligns with Nicaragua's stance against violence targeting non-combatants. My answer: B\n\n3. **International Law**: Nicaragua has consistently supported multilateralism and international law. Drone strikes often occur without UN approval or host nation consent. My answer: B\n\n4. **Long-term Stability**: Such strikes often radicalize populations rather than create stability, similar to how US interventions in Latin America fueled conflicts. My answer: B\n\n5. **Alternative Solutions**: Nicaragua would likely argue for diplomatic and development-based solutions to extremism rather than military ones.

We understand how foreign military actions, even when targeted, can destabilize entire regions and harm civilian populations. My answer: B\n\n6. **Regional Solidarity**: As part of Latin America's non-interventionist tradition, Nicaragua would likely oppose such strikes on principle, seeing them as another form of imperialist overreach. My answer: B\n\n7. **Effectiveness Questioned**: The drone program's track record shows it often creates more militants than it eliminates, similar to how U.S. interventions in Central America fueled longer conflicts. My answer: B\n\n8. **Human Rights**: Nicaragua's revolutionary history emphasizes protection of civilian lives, making the collateral damage from drone strikes particularly unacceptable.
