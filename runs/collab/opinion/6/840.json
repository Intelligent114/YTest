While some may have been active earlier (B) or refuse entirely (D), the flexibility of \"might do\" aligns with the general Indian tendency to engage politically when motivated by specific causes or leaders.  \n\n**Disagreements**: If someone argues for **B (Distant past)**, it could apply to those with prior involvement but not recent activity. If **D (Never do)** is preferred, it might reflect strong anti-political sentiments. However, **C** remains the balanced choice for the group.  \n\nMy answer: C",
