      "content": "Let's discuss this step by step to arrive at a justified answer regarding confidence in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's handling of world affairs.\n\n1. **Global Influence and Diplomacy**: Modi has actively engaged in global diplomacy, strengthening ties with major powers like the U.S., Japan, and Australia (Quad alliance), as well as fostering relationships in Europe and the Global South. His \"Neighbourhood First\" policy has also aimed at improving regional stability. This suggests he has some capability in world affairs.  \n\n2. **Economic and Strategic Policies**: Under Modi, India has positioned itself as a key player in global supply chains and technology partnerships (e.g., semiconductor deals, renewable energy initiatives). However, some critics argue that domestic economic challenges (e.g., unemployment, inequality) could limit his effectiveness on the global stage.  \n\n3. **Controversies and Criticisms**: Modi's foreign policy has faced criticism for being overly transactional or inconsistent, such as balancing relations with Russia and the West during the Ukraine war. His domestic policies (e.g., Hindu nationalism) have also drawn international scrutiny, potentially affecting his global credibility.  \n\n4. **Public Perception**: Surveys like Pew Research show mixed global confidence in Modi, with some nations viewing him positively (e.g., U.S., Israel) and others more skeptically (e.g., parts of Europe).  \n\n**Group Consensus**:  \n- Some members argue for **B (Some confidence)** due to his active diplomacy and India's rising global role.  \n- Others lean toward **C (Not too much confidence)** due to perceived inconsistencies or domestic issues spilling into foreign policy.  \n- Few might abstain (**E**) if unfamiliar with his record.  \n\n**Majority View**: Given Modi's demonstrated engagement in world affairs but mixed outcomes and criticisms, **B (Some confidence)** is the most balanced answer.  \n\n**Dissenting View (if any)**: Someone might argue for **C** if they prioritize his divisive domestic policies over foreign achievements.  \n\nMy answer: B",
