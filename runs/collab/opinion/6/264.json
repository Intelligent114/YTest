This demonstrates that stability must be:\n- Renewable (allowing periodic recalibration through elections)\n- Inclusive (protecting minority participation)\n- Transparent (maintaining clear rules for power transitions)\n\nWhile acknowledging theoretical risks of excessive stability becoming authoritarian, the group finds these manageable through robust democratic safeguards rather than by devaluing stability itself.\n\nFinal determination: Political stability, when properly constituted, is not merely important but fundamentally necessary for democracy's survival and success.\n\nMy answer: A",
