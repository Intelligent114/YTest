Below is the structured reasoning leading to the consensus:  \n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**  \n\n1. **China’s Economic Role**:  \n   - **Strengths**:  \n     - Australia’s largest trading partner, accounting for ~30% of total trade (iron ore, coal, education, agriculture).  \n     - Critical for short-term economic stability and export-driven sectors.  \n   - **Risks**:  \n     - Geopolitical tensions (e.g., trade blockades, political leverage) create vulnerability.  \n     - Over-reliance could limit Australia’s policy autonomy.  \n\n2. **U.S. Economic and Strategic Role**:  \n   - **Strengths**:  \n     - Security ally (AUKUS, Five Eyes) and major investor in technology, defense, and finance.  \n     - Provides diversification and access to Western markets.  \n   - **Risks**:  \n     - Trade volume (~10% of total trade) is smaller than China’s.  \n     - U.S. policies (e.g., inflation reduction, protectionism) can be volatile.  \n\n3. **Why \"Both\" is the Optimal Choice**:  \n   - **Risk Management**: Diversification reduces exposure to shocks from either economy.  \n   - **Complementary Advantages**:  \n     - China sustains export revenue; the U.S. bolsters innovation and security.  \n   - **Geopolitical Flexibility**: Avoids alignment extremes in U.S.-China rivalry.  \n\n4. **Counterarguments Evaluated**:  \n   - **Pro-China**: Trade dominance is undeniable, but ignoring strategic risks is unsustainable.  \n   - **Pro-U.S.**: Security alignment is crucial, but economic costs of decoupling from China are severe.  \n\n5. **Group Agreement**:  \n   - Unanimous consensus that **both** relationships are indispensable for a balanced, resilient economy.  \n\n**Potential Dissent (Hypothetical)**:  \n   - A dissenter might prioritize one partner (e.g., China for immediate gains or the U.S. for long-term security), but this neglects the necessity of a dual-track approach.  \n\n### **Final Answer**  \nMy answer: C",
