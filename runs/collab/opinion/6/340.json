Sending text messages is one of the most common uses of cell phones globally, including in the UK, where SMS and messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, iMessage) are widely used.  \n3. Given the ubiquity of texting as a primary form of communication, it is reasonable to assume the group engages in this activity regularly.  \n4. There is no clear reason to select \"No\" unless the group explicitly avoids texting, which is unlikely.  \n\nNo dissent is noted, as the justification for \"Yes\" is strong.  \n\nMy answer: A",
